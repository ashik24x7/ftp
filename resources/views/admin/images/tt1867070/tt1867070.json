The trio dislike each other and keep their distance. When their grandfather, Khetrapal Singh, passes away, the trio do get together and waste no time in squabbling with each other. They are, however, pleasantly surprised when they find out that he had left a mansion in their respective names. Their joy will turn to anger and disgust after they find out the location as well as the terms and conditions, spread over a period of three years, that go with this procurement.","popularity":0.006294,"poster_path":"\/e3yTeCfJglJ1kcGN3PymmjXZePO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Teen Thay Bhai","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":1010,"character":"Chixie Gill","credit_id":"52fe4746c3a368484e0bde27","id":11851,"name":"Om Puri","order":0,"profile_path":"\/omm9W5Ae1uwccnLPeVB5PWqh0ix.jpg"},{"cast_id":1011,"character":"Happy Gill","credit_id":"52fe4746c3a368484e0bde2b","id":85594,"name":"Deepak Dobriyal","order":1,"profile_path":"\/1AOx25frxPIwWfM9N2iRTDjYQ8J.jpg"},{"cast_id":1012,"character":"Fancy Gill","credit_id":"52fe4746c3a368484e0bde2f","id":53974,"name":"Shreyas Talpade","order":2,"profile_path":"\/bgoWZ3HBvWhXi5ttNsxqdtNsvB3.jpg"},{"cast_id":1013,"character":"Gurleen Kaur","credit_id":"52fe4746c3a368484e0bde33","id":545523,"name":"Ragini Khanna","order":3,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":1014,"character":"Khetarpal Gill","credit_id":"52fe4746c3a368484e0bde37","id":140679,"name":"Yograj Singh","order":4,"profile_path":"\/uOHXL3O5aQnFdO7CN8JpGOP8V06.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe4746c3a368484e0bdded","department":"Directing","id":545514,"job":"Director","name":"Mrighdeep Singh Lamba","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe4746c3a368484e0bddf3","department":"Production","id":53671,"job":"Producer","name":"Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe4746c3a368484e0bddf9","department":"Writing","id":545515,"job":"Writer","name":"Gautam Mehra","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe4746c3a368484e0bddff","department":"Writing","id":545517,"job":"Writer","name":"Mehul Suri","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe4746c3a368484e0bde05","department":"Sound","id":545518,"job":"Music","name":"Daler Mehndi","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe4746c3a368484e0bde0b","department":"Sound","id":545519,"job":"Music","name":"Rajat Dholakia","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe4746c3a368484e0bde11","department":"Sound","id":545520,"job":"Music","name":"Sukhwinder Singh","profile_path":"\/biVKSGnhu4QdbqD2lsa7VB2N5h4.jpg"},{"credit_id":"52fe4746c3a368484e0bde17","department":"Sound","id":545521,"job":"Music","name":"Ranjit Barot","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe4746c3a368484e0bde1d","department":"Crew","id":35808,"job":"Cinematography","name":"Ashok Mehta","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe4746c3a368484e0bde23","department":"Editing","id":545522,"job":"Editor","name":"Arindam Ghatak","profile_path":null}]},"images":{"backdrops":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.69986541049798,"file_path":"\/e3yTeCfJglJ1kcGN3PymmjXZePO.jpg","height":743,"iso_639_1":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":520},{"aspect_ratio":0.70015220700152,"file_path":"\/at6Xw7ZQkogpNywcyD3PJtPpfvb.jpg","height":657,"iso_639_1":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":460},{"aspect_ratio":0.70015220700152,"file_path":"\/jGAEesQ5kj2ZDMX0Nh7qulqXtru.jpg","height":657,"iso_639_1":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":460}]}}
