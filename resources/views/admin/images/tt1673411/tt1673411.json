Ever year rivals Avtar Singh (Sharat Saxena) and Jiten Singh (Om Puri) try to beat each other in the wrestling match and gain the trusteeship of the village. Rama (Rajpal Yadav) plays the role of a village simpleton and a post-master. It filled with misunderstandings and misconceptions, of hidden identities and secret love-affairs and the outcome is simply hilarious.
