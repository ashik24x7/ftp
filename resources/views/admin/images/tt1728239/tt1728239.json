Today, however, Kabir is no longer a cop. In fact, he seems to be doing rather well for himself, driving a Mercedes, working out of a plush office and living in a lavish villa. Naturally, the lads are keen to have some of that, so they promptly bribe Kabir into making them his business partners. What they don't realise is that Kabir has a hidden agenda, shared only with his sexy wife Kamini (Mallika Sherawat) and lovely sister, Kiya (Kangana Ranaut). Before long, the two sides are locked into a game of one-upmanship, with loads of cash at stake. But who will have the last laugh?","popularity":0.008172,"poster_path":"\/yNrkkwlMGV081gsJcK2Z86zT9hy.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Maruti International","id":3985},{"name":"Reliance BIG Entertainment","id":6733}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2011-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"hi","name":"\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940"},{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Let the fun begin again.","title":"Double Dhamaal","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":5,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":9,"character":"Kabir Nayak","credit_id":"52fe4781c3a368484e0cac4b","id":85881,"name":"Sanjay Dutt","order":0,"profile_path":"\/twEuBGXPguRnmTYZgsHr6RWVBNo.jpg"},{"cast_id":10,"character":"Adi \/ Ghanta Singh","credit_id":"52fe4781c3a368484e0cac4f","id":85889,"name":"Arshad Warsi","order":1,"profile_path":"\/1Lh7BefMy2P6leAj3UqizgyB60n.jpg"},{"cast_id":11,"character":"Roy \/ Lee \/ Heera Bhai \/ Tukya \"Kale\" Ram","credit_id":"52fe4781c3a368484e0cac53","id":84957,"name":"Ritesh Deshmukh","order":2,"profile_path":"\/xe0rXlCNcY4RcFjNOygy3LchB4T.jpg"},{"cast_id":12,"character":"Boman \/ Barbara Hori","credit_id":"52fe4781c3a368484e0cac57","id":86087,"name":"Aashish Chaudhary","order":3,"profile_path":"\/vclWY6Pd0FT7lLpDxxnKSszs9Q5.jpg"},{"cast_id":13,"character":"Manav \/ Jojo","credit_id":"52fe4781c3a368484e0cac5b","id":86086,"name":"Javed Jaffrey","order":4,"profile_path":"\/bC45Zhu7ahIFLDkg72Vnan3x0ih.jpg"},{"cast_id":14,"character":"Kamini \/ Jalebi Bai","credit_id":"52fe4781c3a368484e0cac5f","id":70689,"name":"Mallika Sherawat","order":5,"profile_path":"\/3bPv2lMzk3PdOnIBeT0bztYFxPZ.jpg"},{"cast_id":15,"character":"Kiya Nayak","credit_id":"52fe4781c3a368484e0cac63","id":85470,"name":"Kangana Ranaut","order":6,"profile_path":"\/3w61CdyJoBbTIc1K50Sdyyha51B.jpg"},{"cast_id":16,"character":"Baba Batanand Swami","credit_id":"52fe4781c3a368484e0cac67","id":93290,"name":"Satish Kaushik","order":7,"profile_path":"\/7FhKqtVpxxDbEtVdHYxtHxZZLtf.jpg"},{"cast_id":17,"character":"Johnny Banzola","credit_id":"52fe4781c3a368484e0cac6b","id":550330,"name":"Harry Josh","order":8,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":20,"character":"Mohsin Bhai","credit_id":"52fe4781c3a368484e0cac75","id":85656,"name":"Zakir Hussain","order":9,"profile_path":"\/5TKf0ROvgbHKkzP93cU1oF9XI35.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe4781c3a368484e0cac23","department":"Directing","id":105446,"job":"Director","name":"Indra Kumar","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe4781c3a368484e0cac29","department":"Production","id":550326,"job":"Producer","name":"Ashok Thakeria","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe4781c3a368484e0cac2f","department":"Production","id":105446,"job":"Producer","name":"Indra Kumar","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe4781c3a368484e0cac35","department":"Writing","id":550327,"job":"Screenplay","name":"Tushar Hiranandani","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe4781c3a368484e0cac3b","department":"Sound","id":85706,"job":"Music","name":"Anand Raj Anand","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"56602d5ec3a36875f4002d8c","department":"Crew","id":583524,"job":"Cinematography","name":"Aseem Bajaj\t","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe4781c3a368484e0cac47","department":"Editing","id":35739,"job":"Editor","name":"Sanjay Sankla","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe4781c3a368484e0cac71","department":"Writing","id":550327,"job":"Story","name":"Tushar Hiranandani","profile_path":null}]},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.7777777777778,"file_path":"\/aLLZCi1u2SCHnlbnybqf0KmoaJo.jpg","height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.7777777777778,"file_path":"\/i0294YfL0Fyy27eMEQ0oVVPNajn.jpg","height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.7777777777778,"file_path":"\/r4EtV16cuvWtJvJE6OdKsL1RbwH.jpg","height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.69060773480663,"file_path":"\/yNrkkwlMGV081gsJcK2Z86zT9hy.jpg","height":1086,"iso_639_1":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750},{"aspect_ratio":0.76555023923445,"file_path":"\/7yoB2jpo1GIjgBDW4t34KFBKlgX.jpg","height":627,"iso_639_1":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":480},{"aspect_ratio":0.69060773480663,"file_path":"\/fU6QwyQJXLC8tdgHQdtd91zXjQo.jpg","height":1086,"iso_639_1":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]}}
