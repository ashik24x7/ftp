This is where he meets Geet Kaur Dhillon, who is returning home to Bhatinda, and who pays for his ticket. At Bar Nagar, he decides to leave, but she follows him, missing her train. They manage to get a ride to Ratlam, miss the train again, but eventually make it to Bhatinda. Once there, he gets to meet her family; her pretty sister, Roop; as well as her to-be betrothed, Manjeet Singh Mann. Before the engagement could be finalized, she manages to convince her family that she wants to marry Aditya, and they welcome him with open arms. Before he could take stock of these new developments, she elopes with him - not to get married - but to re-locate to Manali - where her true love, Anshuman, is waiting, and who she hopes to get married to.","popularity":0.783026,"poster_path":"\/xOpSDWd217hAcZfeXxoeKodhHEY.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Shree Ashtavinayak Cinevision Ltd","id":3748}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2007-10-26","revenue":4600000,"runtime":145,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"iso_639_1":"hi","name":"\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jab We Met","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":27,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":9,"character":"Aditya Kashyap","credit_id":"52fe44899251416c750383b7","id":78245,"name":"Shahid Kapoor","order":0,"profile_path":"\/9kEn8p2dHhcsqWvL5YTIyhLVs2Z.jpg"},{"cast_id":1,"character":"Geet","credit_id":"52fe44899251416c7503838d","id":37233,"name":"Kareena Kapoor","order":1,"profile_path":"\/kDYeBENXcVKfHJjSHlciNCLmtrG.jpg"},{"cast_id":13,"character":"Roop Kaur Dhillon","credit_id":"52fe44899251416c750383c7","id":150452,"name":"Saumya Tandon","order":2,"profile_path":"\/2KgZwvYCqCsFkKxZ16dx0OjTKrG.jpg"},{"cast_id":3,"character":"Anshuman","credit_id":"52fe44899251416c75038395","id":71271,"name":"Tarun Arora","order":3,"profile_path":"\/57gVixtzcky0r3xqkA9hZLtq3Ck.jpg"},{"cast_id":2,"character":"Dadji","credit_id":"52fe44899251416c75038391","id":70403,"name":"Dara Singh","order":4,"profile_path":"\/93kdPTJWlkGLpy6z5ALrVrB97so.jpg"},{"cast_id":10,"character":"Geet's Chacha","credit_id":"52fe44899251416c750383bb","id":53379,"name":"Pavan Malhotra","order":5,"profile_path":"\/zkLp2IrTM92JmlQBr0wtR45QQgh.jpg"},{"cast_id":11,"character":"Mrs. Dhillon","credit_id":"52fe44899251416c750383bf","id":150013,"name":"Kiran Juneja","order":6,"profile_path":"\/qcW9S6CSinDcbn7udhOahtcgO1X.jpg"},{"cast_id":12,"character":"Mrs. Khanna","credit_id":"52fe44899251416c750383c3","id":150451,"name":"Divya Shah","order":7,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":18,"character":"Kareena's younger sister","credit_id":"565dae3d9251416da4003369","id":1267400,"name":"Wamiqa Gabbi","order":8,"profile_path":"\/yO7PbZe776j4VnrAKHDaabYjPnS.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe44899251416c7503839b","department":"Production","id":71272,"job":"Producer","name":"Dhilin Mehta","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe44899251416c750383a1","department":"Sound","id":71273,"job":"Original Music Composer","name":"Pritam Chakraborty","profile_path":"\/tQAsMlqsdTKUyI48wr6r5I5EZSO.jpg"},{"credit_id":"52fe44899251416c750383ad","department":"Editing","id":71275,"job":"Editor","name":"Aarti Bajaj","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe44899251416c750383b3","department":"Directing","id":71276,"job":"Director","name":"Imtiaz Ali","profile_path":"\/h6qU8sV5h4dIvh5kJL0iOx6MrSU.jpg"},{"credit_id":"52fe44899251416c750383cd","department":"Writing","id":71276,"job":"Writer","name":"Imtiaz Ali","profile_path":"\/h6qU8sV5h4dIvh5kJL0iOx6MrSU.jpg"},{"credit_id":"537ef0d8c3a36805a1002844","department":"Sound","id":66949,"job":"Music","name":"Sandesh Shandilya","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"537ef128c3a36805920028d0","department":"Sound","id":123223,"job":"Original Music Composer","name":"Sanjoy Chowdhury","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"550af7e6c3a368487d001a9c","department":"Camera","id":223148,"job":"Director of Photography","name":"Natraj","profile_path":"\/v8RNwKtSuy00dIEzlmj8LA3flJA.jpg"},{"credit_id":"566d84f0c3a3680e7300732b","department":"Crew","id":223148,"job":"Cinematography","name":"Natraj","profile_path":"\/v8RNwKtSuy00dIEzlmj8LA3flJA.jpg"}]},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.7777777777778,"file_path":"\/zVuhOXV5sykgaWYNnSkru4gJZ8C.jpg","height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"vote_average":5.3699633699634,"vote_count":2,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.7777777777778,"file_path":"\/12U56SDgXToQTH3NJeRzsbymgLp.jpg","height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"vote_average":5.3479853479854,"vote_count":2,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.7777777777778,"file_path":"\/zB9hW2KfdLB1YDwYTAQDl8rtBdA.jpg","height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"vote_average":5.3186813186813,"vote_count":2,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.7777777777778,"file_path":"\/iK7fXSQ26PJ9rUBtLwCEuiiXK45.jpg","height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"vote_average":5.1868131868132,"vote_count":2,"width":1280}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.69095477386935,"file_path":"\/xOpSDWd217hAcZfeXxoeKodhHEY.jpg","height":796,"iso_639_1":null,"vote_average":5.2901785714286,"vote_count":1,"width":550},{"aspect_ratio":0.6891064871481,"file_path":"\/lF4jA6bLdH0uXeNKzJSiKnhFXdT.jpg","height":817,"iso_639_1":null,"vote_average":5.2752976190476,"vote_count":1,"width":563}]}}
